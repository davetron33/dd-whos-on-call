it's a slackbot that tells you who's currently on call for your datadog team rotation.
once again the result of me staying up too late and deciding to write some code.

presented as-is, no frills. wouldn't recommend anyone actually use this. missing pretty much every feature that would make this worth using. maybe I'll expand on this eventually.

(probably wont tho)
